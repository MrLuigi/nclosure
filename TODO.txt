TODO
====

HIGH
----

- Fix non source code install (npm)

MED
---

- Better docs, perhaps github pages

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Run jsdoc on entire project and document files better

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

LOW
---

- JSDoc should run in parallel for performance

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
