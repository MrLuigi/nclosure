TODO
====

- Find a way of compiling utils.js and removing it from the static.externs.js file
- Change all goog.node namespaces to node.goog or perhaps even change
  all node.goog to ngoog
- Implement tests to ensure all files pass all validations and basic
  funcitonality works. This will allow quick testing on multiple platforms
- Tests need to better print errors
- Add better command line support for compilation
  - Do not generate deps.js or file.min.js option
  - Do not compile dependencies
- Unit tests should run recursivelly into directories of tests
- Running individual tests say: 'Starting tests: Untitled Test Case'. Lets give the
  tests a name, file name should be fine
- Currently all paths in settings are absolute
  they should also allow relative from the settings file location
