TODO
====
- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).
- googtest stops at first failure it should run all tests and give summary of
  failures.
- Display test results better, perhaps implement a console test runner that
shows progress? and green / red style ui?

GOOG HACKS THAT NEED ATTENTION
==============================
- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution
- goog.js has lots of hacks to integrate into the libs, clean this up
- Testing code is horrible fix this up, perhaps implement own version of
  MultiTestRunner optimised for console
