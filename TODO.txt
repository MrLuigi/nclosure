TODO
====
- googtest stops at first failure it should run all tests and give summary of
  failures.
- gootest failure stack traces are empty
- Display test results better, perhaps implement a console test runner that
shows progress? and green / red style ui?
- jsdoc uses jsrun.jar perhaps we can remove java alltogether and run it in
  node?

GOOG HACKS THAT NEED ATTENTION
==============================
- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution
- goog.js has lots of hacks to integrate into the libs, clean this up
- Testing code is horrible fix this up, perhaps implement own version of
  MultiTestRunner optimised for console
