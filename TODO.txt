TODO
====

HIGH
----

- Fix npm install.  Currently requires full git clone to work.

- Better jsdoc stylesheet

MED
---

- Better project documentation, perhaps github pages

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Run jsdoc on entire project and improve code documentation

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

LOW
---

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
