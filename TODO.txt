TODO
====
- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

GOOGTEST
=========
- googtest needs more work its quite buggy
  - Running sungle tests does not log anything to stderr or stdout
  - googtest should run (exec) tests in parallel?
  - googtests are stepping on each others toes.  They can overwrite their
    functions?!?!?!

GOOG HACKS THAT NEED ATTENTION
==============================
- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution
- goog.js has lots of hacks to integrate into the libs, clean this up
- Testing code is horrible fix this up, perhaps implement own version of
  MultiTestRunner optimised for console
