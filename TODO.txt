TODO
====

- Make all paths relative to the working directory in settingsloader.getPath,
  this will clean up commands a little

- checkAllSampleTestsPassing.js needs a better mechanism to to integarte to
  new nctest framework

- When tests fail with an exception we do not get a report

- Add acknoledgement file for all acks

- Make compile output a bit cleaner, no need to print out command by default

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Fix non source code install (npm)

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Add a script to update all third_party libraries and to fix all required
  deps in the source code

- JSDoc should run in parallel for performance

- Use JSDoc as a CTAGs generator

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
