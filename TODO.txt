TODO
====
- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Remove the require('goog').goog.init() make it require('goog').init()
  i.e. remove the redundant intermediate goog.

- Add a script to update all third_party libraries and to fix all required
  deps in the source code

- When running googtest tests/compilerCommandLineArgsTests.js we get 2
  'undefined's printed to console

- Is there any use in generating the .min.js files by default? Perhaps add
  a command line arg for this

GOOGTEST
=========
- googtest needs more work its quite buggy
  - Running sungle tests does not log anything to stderr or stdout
  - googtest should run (exec) tests in parallel?
  - googtests are stepping on each others toes.  They can overwrite their
    functions?!?!?!

GOOG HACKS THAT NEED ATTENTION
==============================
- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution
- goog.js has lots of hacks to integrate into the libs, clean this up
- Testing code is horrible fix this up, perhaps implement own version of
  MultiTestRunner optimised for console
