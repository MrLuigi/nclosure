TODO
====

- Find a way of compiling utils.js and removing it from the static.externs.js file
- Tests need to better print errors
- Add better command line support for compilation
  - Do not generate deps.js or file.min.js option
  - Do not compile dependencies
- googtest should run recursivelly into directories of tests
- Running individual tests say: 'Starting tests: Untitled Test Case'. Lets give the
  tests a name, file name should be fine
- Currently all paths in settings are absolute
  they should also allow relative from the settings file location
- Asynchronous tests not working in googtest
