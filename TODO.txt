TODO
====

HIGH
----

- Fix npm install.  Currently requires full git clone to work.

- google's pretty print requires that code blocks use the pretty print class
  this is sucky. Add an onload handler to codeview all.js to auto add
 'prettyprint' to all code and pre blocks.

- codeview template only styles class pre.code just make it pre.

- Better syntax highlightinh in code view.

- Allow go to method source when clicking on method name (details)

- Better jsdoc stylesheet

MED
---

- Better project documentation, perhaps github pages

- Redo the examples, make more relevant samples

- Run jsdoc on entire project and improve code documentation

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

LOW
---

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_lib_tsts.html
