TODO
====
- Rename project

- Fix non source code install (npm)

- Not working on cygwin (running through the linked npm commands is not
  working, actually running the js files in bin manually works if we update
  the paths to be all relative).

- Add a script to update all third_party libraries and to fix all required
  deps in the source code

- Failing tests makes output very complex and unreadable

- googtest should run (exec) tests in parallel, this would also solve any
context sharing issues.

- JSDoc should run in parallel for performance

- Use JSDoc as a CTAGs generator

- Include GJSLINT and FIXJSSTYLE in distribution

- Improve the number of closure tests passing the test suite. see
  tests/closure_tests_report.html
