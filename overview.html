    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure Tools</a> are a powerful set
    of utilities that aim to make large scale JavaScript development more
    manageable.  This project brings the power of the closure tools to the
    <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">node</a>
    platform. The closure tools gives developers the utilities required to improve
    code design and maintainability by providing support for:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Enhanced Modularisation (Both logically and physically)</li>
    <li>Better Encapsulation</li>
    <li>Type Safety</li>
    <li>Interfaces and Mixins</li>
    <li>Rich Source Documentation</li>
    <li>A Huge Library of Production Ready Utilities, including:

    <ul>
    <li>Collections / Arrays</li>
    <li>Testing / Mocking</li>
    <li>Async Development</li>
    <li>Encryption</li>
    <li>Date / Date Range Support</li>
    <li>Events</li>
    <li>Internationalisation</li>
    <li>Locale</li>
    <li>Math</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Structs</li>
    <li><a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/docs/index.html">More...</a></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul><h2>Installation (core)</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Install <code>nclosure</code>.  By getting the source (NPM install comming soon):</p>

    <pre>
    git clone git://github.com/gatapia/nclosure.git
    cd nclosure
    npm link
    </pre>


     <h2>Advanced Configuration</h2>

    <p><code>nclosure</code> can be configured in several ways.  The easiest is to modify the
    <code>bin/closure.json</code> file with your global settings.  Settings here can be
    extended by placing a <code>closure.json</code> file in your source directory. You can
    also place a <code>closure.json</code> in the directory running <code>node</code> (The cwd).</p>

    <p>Finally, <code>nclosure</code> can also be configured by passing an optional options
    object to the <code>require('nclosure').nclosure(opts);</code> call.</p>

    <p>All configuration files and configuration objects take the following format:</p>

    <pre>
    {
      closureBasePath: Location of the closure-library.  This defaults to
        the closure library included in this package.
      additionalDeps: Any additional dependency files required to run your
        code.  These files generally point to other closure libraries.
        Note these deps files must have paths relative to this setting
        file or be absolute.
      compiler_jar: Path to the compiler jar you want to use.  This defaults
        to the included compiler.jar file so only change this if you want
        to use a custom compiler.
      additionalCompileOptions: Additional compiler options,
        e.g.: "['--jscomp_warning=newWarningType']"
      additionalCompileRoots: These are directories containing source code
        that needs to be included in the compilation.  If this is not
        included then additionalDeps is used to try to guess any additional
        roots required (assumes that the deps.js file is in the root folder
        of the source directory).
      jsdocToolkitDir: The location of jsdoc-toolkit.  This is only required
        if you want to use jsdoc-toolkit to document your source code. This
        defaults to the jsdoc instance included in this package.
      additionalJSDocToolkitOptions: Additional jsdoc-toolkit options,
        e.g.: "['-D="noGlobal:true"']"
      additionalLinterOptions: Additional gjslint and fixjsstyle options,
        e.g.: "['--summary=true']"
      nodeDir: The location of the node source code.  This is only required
        if you are contributing to the nclosure project or would like to
        update your node-extern files.
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Note: All paths can be absolute or relative to the location of the current
    settings file.</p>

    <h2>More Help</h2>

    <p>The best way to get going with nclosure is to look at the nclosure code (bin,
    lib and examples directories).  All nclosure code is annotated and should
    give you a good introduction to what can be acchieved with the tool.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, issues, complaints, suggestions, .... just email me
    (guido@tapia.com.au) and I'll see what I can do to help.</p>

    <h2>Kown Limitations</h2>

    <p>Since the Node.js core libs are not jsdoc'ed in any way I could not give any
    type safety when using these core libs.</p>

    <p>The documentation template is lacking in several areas this will be improved
    in the future.</p>

    <p>Linter is a pain to instal.</p>

    <p>Poor project documentation.</p>

    <p>For an up to date list of issues see the TODO.txt file.  Later I will start an
    issues list on github.</p>
